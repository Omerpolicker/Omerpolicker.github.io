<h1>Three Little Pigs- The Game</h1>
<p>Once upon a time there were three little pigs and when they were old enough, they went out into the world to seek their fortunes.</p>

<p>The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. </p>
<p>The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. </p>
<p>The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney.</p>

<h2>Which Pig Do you Want to Be?</h2>

<p>The next day, a wolf passed by the three little pigs houses. So he knocked on the door of pig 1 and said:</p>

 <br/> Then I'll huff 
 <br/>and I'll puff 
 <br/> and I'll blow your house down." </a> </button>

<p>So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down and then ate Pig 1 </p>

<p>The wolf continued down the street and he passed by pig 2's house made of sticks. He smelled the pigs and his mouth began to water </p>

<p>So he knocked on the door and said: </p> 

<button> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQ5d7zjOec" target= "_blank"> "If you dont let me in!
 <br/> Then I'll huff 
 <br/>and I'll puff 
 <br/> and I'll blow your house down." </a> </button>

<p> The pig said "no way!" So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down and then ate Pig 2 </p>

<p> The wolf had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell pig 3 inside his brick home. So he knocked on the door of pig 3 and said: </p>

<button> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQ5d7zjOec" target= "_blank"> "If you dont let me in!
 <br/> Then I'll huff 
 <br/>and I'll puff 
 <br/> and I'll blow your house down." </a> </button> 

<p> The pig said "get lost evil wolf!" </p>
<p> So, the wolf huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. </p>
