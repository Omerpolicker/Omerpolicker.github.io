            <h1>Three Little Pigs - The Game</h1>
            <p>
                Once upon a time there were three little pigs and when they were old enough, they went out into the world to seek their fortunes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was lazy too and he built his house out of sticks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next day, a wolf passed by the three little pigs' houses. So he knocked on the door of <span id="chosen-pig"></span> and said:
            </p>
            <p>
                "If you don't let me in!
                Then I'll huff
                and I'll puff
                and I'll blow your house down."
            </p>
            <p>
                So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down and then ate <span id="chosen-pig-eaten"></span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wolf continued down the street and he passed by <span id="unchosen-pig"></span>'s house. He smelled the pigs and his mouth began to water.
            </p>
        <p>
            So he knocked on the door and said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "If you don't let me in!
            Then I'll huff
            and I'll puff
            and I'll blow your house down."
        </p>
        <p>
            The pig said "no way!" So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down and then ate <span id="unchosen-pig"></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wolf had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell pig 3 inside his brick home. So he knocked on the door of pig 3 and said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "If you don't let me in!
            Then I'll huff
            and I'll puff
            and I'll blow your house down."
        </p>
        <p>
            The pig said "get lost evil wolf!"
        </p>
        <p>
            So, the wolf huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore.
        </p>
