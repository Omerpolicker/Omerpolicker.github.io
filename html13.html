        <p>Once upon a time there were three little pigs and when they were old enough, they went out into the world to seek their fortunes.</p>
       
        <p>The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw.</p>
        <p>The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was lazy too and he built his house out of sticks.</p>
        <p>The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney.</p>

    <!-- Hidden part of the story -->
    <div id="hidden-story" class="hidden-story">
        <p>The next day, a wolf passed by the three little pigs' houses. So he knocked on the door of <span id="chosen-pig"></span> and said:</p>
        <p>"If you don't let me in!
            Then I'll huff
            and I'll puff
            and I'll blow your house down."</p>
        <p>So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down and then ate <span id="chosen-pig-eaten"></span>.</p>
        <p>The wolf continued down the street and he passed by <span id="unchosen-pig"></span>'s house. He smelled the pigs and his mouth began to water.</p>
        <p>So he knocked on the door and said:</p>
        <p>"If you don't let me in!
            Then I'll huff
            and I'll puff
            and I'll blow your house down."</p>
        <h2>The pig said "no way!"</h2>  
        <p>Click to huff and puff <span id="unchosen-pig"></span>:</p>
        <div id="unchosen-pig-button-placeholder"></div>
    </div>
     
    <div id="hidden-story2" class="hidden-story2" style="display: none;">
        <p>So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down and then ate <span id="unchosen-pig"></span>.</p>
        <p>The wolf had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell pig 3 inside his brick home. So he knocked on the door of pig 3 and said:</p>
        <p>"If you don't let me in!
            Then I'll huff
            and I'll puff
            and I'll blow your house down."</p>
        <p>The pig said "get lost evil wolf!"</p>

        <h2>Slide to huff and puff!</h2>

        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="1">
        </div>
            </div>

    <div id="hidden-story3" class="hidden-story3" style="display: none;">
        <p>So, the wolf huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; </p>
        <p>But he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. </p>
        <p>Pig 3 was safe and the wolf went to nap.</p>
